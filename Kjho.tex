\subsection*{Euclidean space}

\begin{df} Euclidean space is $V, \langle . \rangle$, where
    $V$ is a vector space over $\R$ and $\langle . \rangle$ is a bilinear form
    called dot product. \end{df}

What we already know about it:
\[
    \norm{x} = \sqrt{\dotp{x, x}},\
    \rho(x, y) = \norm{x - y},\
    |\dotp{x, y}| \le \norm{x}\norm{y} \]
Also we can define cosine of angle between vectors:
\[ -1 \le \frac{\dotp{x, y}}{\norm{x}{y}} \le 1 \]
And projection:
\[ \proj_{v}: V \to \dotp{v}, \proj_{v}{x} = \frac{v}{\norm{v}} \norm{x} \cos \alpha =
    \frac{\dotp{x, v}}{\norm{v}^2} v \]
Or projection on $\dotp{v}^\perp$ by subtracting: $x - \proj_vx$.

\subsection*{Gram-Schmidt process}

\begin{df} Set of vectors $e_i$ in a Euclidean space
    is called orthnormal if $e_i \perp e_j$ and $\norm{e_i} = 1$ \end{df}

\begin{df} Orthogonalization is a process which for a set of vectors
    $e_i$ gives another set $f_i$, that are orthnormal and
    $\forall k: \dotp{e_1 \dots e_k} = \dotp{f_1 \dots f_k}$ \end{df}

Necessarily $f_1 = \frac{e_1}{\norm{e_1}}$, because 
$\dotp{f_1} = \dotp{e_1}, \norm{f_1} = 1$.

Now, $f_i \perp \dotp{e_1\dots e_{i-1}} \iff f_i \perp \dotp{f_1 \dots f_{i-1}}$.
Also it should contain something about $e_i$ in it, so we can just subtract all projections: 
\[f_i = e_i - \sum \proj_{f_j}{e_i}\]
Then just normalize it.
